        <h1>Intro to Logic Gates</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Learn Logic!  In this first lesson we will start by discussing logic gates and introduce one example of a logic gate. After that you can try applying what you have learned in the logic gate simulator. Let's get started!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Logic gates are the building blocks of electronic circuits. There are various types of logic gates and each one carries out a basic logic function. When logic gates are connected in the proper combination, they can carry out more complex functions. While some simple circuits may have only a few logic gates, more complex circuits like microprocessors can have millions of them. Each logic gate has at least one input and an output. There are two possible values for an input and output. The values are 0 and 1 or false and true respectively. This may sound complicated, but donâ€™t worry we will take it slow by learning about different logic gates one at a time.</p>

        <p>The first logic gate that we will discuss is the NAND gate. It is important because multiple NAND gates used in the right combination can be used to produce any other type of logic gate. The NAND gate is often used as a basis for forming logic circuits, so it is a good starting point in learning about logic gates. It takes two inputs, where the output is true if and only if no more than one of the inputs is true. If both inputs are true, the output becomes false. Below is a picture of a NAND gate as well as a truth table with each possible combination of inputs and their corresponding output.</p>
